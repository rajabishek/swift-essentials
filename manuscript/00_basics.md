# The Basics
Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, OS X, tvOS, and watchOS that is safe fast and interactive. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and apps run lightning-fast. It seems to me Swift is designed to lure web developers to build apps. The syntax of Swift would be more familiar to web developers. If you have some programming experience with Javascript (or other scripting languages), it would be easier for you to pick up Swift rather than Objective-C.

# Variables & Constants
Like any other language swift uses variable to store and refrence values by an identifying name. Swift also makes extensive use of variable whose values cannot be changed. These are know as constants and much more powerful that constants in C.

Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types, including ```swift Int``` for integers, ```swift Double``` and ```swift Float``` for floating point values, ```swift Bool``` for boolean values, and ```swift String``` for textual data. These are some of the primitive dataypes that are present in swift. Apart from theses swift provides three powerul collection types ```swift Array```,```swift Set``` and ```swift Dictionary```. 

Swift also introduces certain advanced types such a tuples. Tuple enables us to create and pass around a group of values. For example we can use this to return multiple values from a function as a single compound value by creating a tuple.

Swift also introduces optional types, which can handle the absense of a value. These are called as optionals. Optionals say either there is a value, and it equals x or there isn't a value at all. They are the heart of may of Swift's most powerful features.
