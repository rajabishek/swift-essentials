# Collection views in iOS


Collection views were first introduced by Apple with the release of iOS 6 during 2012 wwdc. Collection views allows us to easily create dynamic and incredible interfaces by organizing data in grid-like layouts using the built-in UICollectionViewFlowLayout class. If you have no idea about what grid layout means, just take a look at the built-in Photos app.
