## Introduction

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers and Bob Martin that refers to a set of five principles, when applied together, intend to make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time. The five principles are as follows:
> - S - Single Responsibility Principle
> - O - Open/Closed Principle
> - L - Liskov Substitution Principle
> - I - Interface Segregation Principle
> - D - Dependency Inversion Principle

Let's dive deeper into each one of these principles and look at some examples.
