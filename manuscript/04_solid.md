# SOLID

[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) is a mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers and Bob Martin that refers to a set of five principles, when applied together, intend to make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time. The five principles are as follows:
- S - [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
- O - [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)
- L - [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
- I - [Interface Segregation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
- D - [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)

Let's dive deeper into each one of these principles and look at some examples. The code sample presented in this article will 

# Single Responsibility Principle
The single responsibility principle states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software. It helps keep classes and methods small and maintainable. In addition to keeping classes small and focused it also makes them easier to understand.
