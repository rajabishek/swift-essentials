[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) is a mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers and Bob Martin that refers to a set of five principles, when applied together, intend to make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time. The five principles are as follows:
- S - [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
- O - [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)
- L - [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
- I - [Interface Segregation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
- D - [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)

Let's dive deeper into each one of these principles and look at some examples.
