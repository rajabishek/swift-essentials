# Acknowledgements

I have many people to thank for making this book happen.
First, I must thank my brother Sailesh Dev, and my parents Devaprakash and Kaniamuthu, for putting up with their Son always pecking away at the computer. Even when not writing books, my obsession with Swift glues my eyes to the screen far more than it should. That time I borrow from my family is the reason these books can so deeply and completely explain Swift to you, the reader. I owe my family everything.
