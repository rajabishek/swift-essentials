# Concurrency in Swift

This is an important concept that no developer can skip. It is a powerful feature that lets developers write efficient, fast, and responsive applications. But with great power comes great responsibility. But once you understand the inner workings and dive a little deeper it becomes very easy to implement.

In iOS we have multiple APIs that can be used to achieve concurrency. One is NSOperation and its associated classes and the other one is Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).
