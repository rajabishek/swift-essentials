# Operators in Swift
An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values. In essence an operator is a symbol or phrase that represents a functionality. For example, `name = "String"` in Swift uses the assignment operator = which has a functionality of storing the string value "Apple" in the `name` variable. 

Many languages also have phrases that are operators, like `typeof` in Javascript, `sizeof` in C,and the type-cast operator `as` in Swift are some of the examples.
