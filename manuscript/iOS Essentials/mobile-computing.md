## Multiplexing
 - Multiplexing describes how several users can share a medium with minimum or no interference.
 - The task of multiplexing is to assign space, time, frequency, and code to each communication channel with a minimum of interference and a maximum of medium utilization.
 - Communication channel here only refers to an association of sender(s) and receiver(s) who want to exchange data.
 - In wireless communication, multiplexing can be carried out in four dimensions: space, time, frequency, and code.

 ## Space division multiplexing
- Following image shows six channels ki and introduces a three dimensional coordinate system, where system shows the dimensions of code c, time t and frequency f.
- For space division multiplexing (SDM), the (three dimensional) space si represented via circles indicates the interference range.

- The channels k1 to k3 can be mapped onto the three ‘spaces’ s1 to s3 which clearly separate the channels and prevent the interference ranges from overlapping. 
- The space between the interference ranges is sometimes called guard space. 
- Such a guard space is needed in all four multiplexing schemes presented.
- This procedure clearly represents a waste of space.
- This principle was used by the old analog telephone system: each subscriber is given a separate pair of copper wires to the local exchange.
- In wireless transmission, SDM implies a separate sender for each communication channel with a wide enough distance between senders. Eg In FM radio stations where the transmission range is limited to a certain region, many radio stations around the world can use the same frequency without interference.
- Problems arise if two or more channels were established within the same space, for example, if several radio stations want to broadcast in the same city.
