## Multiplexing
 - Multiplexing describes how several users can share a medium with minimum or no interference.
 - The challenge in multiplexing is to minimize interference and maximize medium utilization.
 - In wireless communication, multiplexing can be carried out in four dimensions: space, time, frequency, and code.
