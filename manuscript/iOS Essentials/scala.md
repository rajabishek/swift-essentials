## Introduction
Lets learn a bit about function programming from first principles. We will look at functional programming, methods to construct them and ways to reason about them. Functional programming is a paradigm that is quite different from the classical imperative paradigm that we know from languages such as Java, C++ or C. In fact we can combine the two paradigms and its one of the Scala's strengths that it provides a gradual migration path from a more concise Java like language to a full functional programming.

Suspend for most of what you know about programming and look at programs with fresh eyes. That way we will be able to absorb this new way of thinking in functional programming and be able to integrate that back into our daily programming practice. In fact Scala is beautiful way to learn functional programming from first principles and later on to integrate it with classical object oriented programming.

## Programming Paradigms
**Paradigm** : In science, a paradigm describe distinct concepts or thought patterns in some scientific discipline.
Main programming paradigms:
- Imperative programming
- Functional programming
- Logic programming

Orthogonal to it :
- Object oriented programming

Many people call object oriented programming as a paradigm but I see it as orthogonal in nature, meaning it can be combined with any of the 3 programming paradigms. We can combine it with imperative, functional or logic programming paradigm.

## Imperative Programming
Imperative programming is about
- Modifying mutable variables
- Using assignments
- And control structures such as if-else, loops, break, continue, return.

The most informal way to understand imperative programs is as instructions for a Von Neumann computer.
