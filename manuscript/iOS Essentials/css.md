## Default Styling
Every browser has a default styling. The browser has a default style sheet that it will apply to the html pages. There misght be slight differences between one browser and another, but all desktop browsers will render pages in a similar manner, there won't be huge variations. You can click the preferences for the browser and change some of the default styling attributes, like the default font and size etc. When we write a style sheet we are actually overriding the browser's default style sheet.

So it is important that we understand what the browser's default styles are because we will be overriding based on that. Or another way would be to use a CSS reset that removes all the browser's default styling and start from scratch.
