- The `android` command opens the standalone android SDK manager application.
- Running the `android avd` command will open the AVD manager that is used to manage the virtual devices.
- Running `android list avd` will list all the existing virtual devices.
- Run the `emulator -avd <avd-name>` to launch the virtual device. Pressing ctrl+c will abort the process and sometimes curropt the ondisk storage of the virtual device. This isn't a disaster, you can wipe the storage clean and start over.
