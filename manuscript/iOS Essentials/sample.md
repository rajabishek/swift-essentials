# Understanding Windows and Screens

A window handles the overall presentation of your app’s user interface. Windows work with views (and their owning view controllers) to manage interactions with—and changes to—the visible view hierarchy.

Every app has one window that displays the app’s user interface on an iOS-based device display. If an external display is connected to the device, an app can create a second window to present content on that display as well.
