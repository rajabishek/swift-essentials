## Lessons Learnt
- Most of the problems that we face today are because of poorly designed products
- Every product/service that we use is made by someone else like us to who'm the credit should go for or blamed for bad products
- User experience is how a product works on the outside rather than the inner workings or what the product does, it essentials answers the question what itâ€™s like to use the product or service ?
- Sound is an important part of the aesthetic appeal of a product.
- A well-designed product is one that does what it promises to do, functionality or aesthetics is only a part. Eg If a pen that looks pretty with a torch and a spy camera doesn't write when there is enough ink then its a clear indication of bad design.
- The correct shape or form of the product dictated by the psychology and behavior of the users and not the functionality.
