# User Experience & Why It matters ?
## Why is this important ?
- Most of the problems that we face today are because of poorly designed products.
- Every product/service that we use is made by someone else like us to whom the credit should go for good design or be blamed for bad products.

## What is user experience ?
- User experience is how a product works on the outside rather than the inner workings or what the product does, it essentially answers the question **what itâ€™s like to use the product or service ?**
- A well designed product is one that does what it promises to do, functionality or aesthetics is only a part of good design. A pretty looking pen with a torch and a spy camera that doesn't write when there is enough ink is clearly a badly designed product.
- Greater the complexity the more difficult it becomes to identify exactly how to deliver a successful experience to the user.
- User experience effort aims to improve efficiency i.e helping people work faster(time is money) and helping them make fewer mistakes(greater job satisfaction == less people quit, more experienced staff provide higher quality work).

## Principles
- Sound is an important part of the aesthetic appeal of a product.
- The correct shape or form of the product should be dictated by the psychology and behavior of the users rather than the functionality.
- User centric design - Take the user into account every step of the way as you develop your product. In this way you will know all the ramifications of your decisions and compromises will not happen by accident.
