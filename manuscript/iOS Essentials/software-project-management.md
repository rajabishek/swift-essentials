# Activity Planning
So far we have looked at how to forecast the efforts required for the project as a whole and individual activities, but a complete plan must also include a schedule indicating the start and end times for each activity. This will help in:
- **Resources** are available when required
- Avoid **different** activities competing for same resources at the same time
- Detailed schedule showing which **staff** needs to carry out which activity
- A plan in which achievement is **measurable**
- Produce a **timed** cash flow forecast
- Ability to **re-plan** if the project drifts from the target
**R D S M T R** can be used to remember the above points.

Monitoring the project's progress is ensuring that the deliverables of each activity are delivered on time. It is unlikely that everything will go as per plan. The activity plan should provides means of evaluating the consequences of not meeting any of the activity target dates and guidance as to how the plan most effectively be modified to bring the project back to target, i.e when something has gone wrong, understanding the consequences and identifying it causes to mitigate its effects.
