# Activity Planning
So far we have seen how to forecast the efforts required for the project as a whole and the individual activities, but a complete plan must also include the start and end times for each activity. This will help in:
- **Resources** are available when required.
- Avoiding **different** activities competing for same resources at the same time.
- Detailed schedule showing which **staff** needs to carry out which activity.
- Producing a plan in which achievement is **measurable**.
- Producing a **timed** cash flow forecast.
- Ability to **re-plan** if the project drifts from the target.
**R D S M T R** can be used to remember the above points.
