# Activity Planning
So far we have looked at how to forecast the efforts required for the project as a whole and individual activities, but a complete plan must also include a schedule indicating the start and end times for each activity. This will help in:
- **Resources** are available when required
- Avoid **different** activities competing for same resources at the same time
- Detailed schedule showing which **staff** needs to carry out which activity
- A plan in which achievement is **measurable**
- Produce a **timed** cash flow forecast
- Ability to **re-plan** if the project drifts from the target
**R D S M T R** can be used to remember the above points.
