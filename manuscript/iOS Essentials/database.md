Retrieve all the information from the cd.facilities table?
```sql
SELECT facid,name,membercost,guestcost,initialoutlay,monthlymaintenance 
FROM cd.facilities;
```

You want to print out a list of all of the facilities and their cost to members. How would you retrieve a list of only facility names and costs?
```sql
SELECT name, membercost 
FROM cd.facilities;
```

How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members?
```sql
SELECT * FROM cd.facilities 
WHERE membercost > 0;
```
How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost? Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.
```sql
SELECT facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance 
FROM cd.facilities 
WHERE membercost > 0 AND membercost < monthlymaintenance/50;
```
