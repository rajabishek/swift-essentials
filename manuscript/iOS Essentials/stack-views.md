#Stack View in iOS
iOS 9 includes a new UIView subclass called UIStackView, that simplifies the ways in which we defined layouts for mous of the user interfaces. Its comes with full support in the interface builder and reduces a lot of headache that arise when working with complicated user interfaces and large number of auto layout constraints. The options that apple has given in terms of laying out interface elements on the screen has been pretty fabulous. 

In WWDC 2012 when apple introduced iOS 6 it introduced the concept of auto layouts to support multiple screen sizes. Autolayout changed the way how developer and designers worked and thought in terms of laying out the elements on the screen, everything was relationships and values that were with respect to other elements.
