#Stack View in iOS
iOS 9 includes a new UIView subclass called UIStackView, that simplifies the ways in which we defined layouts for mous of the user interfaces. Its comes with full support in the interface builder and reduces a lot of headache that arise when working with complicated user interfaces and large number of auto layout constraints. The options that apple has given in terms of laying out interface elements on the screen has been pretty fabulous.
