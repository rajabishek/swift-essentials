#Stack View in iOS
iOS 9 includes a new UIView subclass called UIStackView, that simplifies the ways in which we defined layouts for most of the user interfaces. Its comes with full support in the interface builder and reduces a lot of headache that arises when working with complicated user interfaces and with a large number of auto layout constraints. The options that apple has given in terms of laying out interface elements on the screen has been pretty fabulous. 

In WWDC 2012 when apple introduced iOS 6 it introduced the concept of auto layouts to support multiple screen sizes. Autolayout changed the way how developer and designers worked and thought in terms of laying out the elements on the screen, everything was relationships and values that were with respect to other elements. 

In WWDC 2014 apple introduced adaptive layout that sits on top of auto layout and allows for universal layout meaning that now we just have a single storyboard for deigning for iphone or ipad. It introduced the concept of sizes classes and simplified the whole process, essentialy allowing to develop layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. 

In 2015 Apple introduced a new feature for laying out elements called as UIStackView. You should understand here that auto layout and adaptive layout are features that are required. Whereas stack view is a feature that in not absolutely neccessary for you to implement. By using it it just makes your life easy, its not that without stack views we can't build certain type of user interfaces. If you use stack view its just that you can be quicker and maintain the project in a better way.
